    </h2>
    <p>If you experience a laggy interface, this can have several reasons. For
    one some chat channels are very busy and depending on your computer, this
    may not be easy to handle. Managing the userlist can cost a lot of
    performance in large channels because of having to react to hundreds of
    users joining or leaving at once. It can help to temporarily
    <a href="help.html#ignoreJoinsParts">ignore joins/parts</a> in this case.</p>
    
    <p>You may also want to check if Irc logging is enabled in the Debug Window
        (<code>Expert - Debug window - Checkbox: Irc log</code>), which should
    be disabled by default, but can lower performance if checked.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>If you get this error, you started Chatty with Hotkey support, but it
    couldn't load the library (.dll) necessary to register hotkeys. This can
    either mean that the file isn't stored where the program can find it or you
    have the wrong version for your version of Java (32bit or 64bit Java need
    different versions of the .dll).</p>
    
    <p>First of all, you currently only need Global Hotkey support when you want
        to run commercials using a global hotkey. If you don't, you can just ignore
        that message or download the version of Chatty without Hotkey support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Otherwise, find out if you have the 64bit or 32bit version
        of Java, then check if you downloaded the matching Version of Chatty.
        Enter <code>/wdir</code> in Chatty to find out what your working directory
    is and make sure the JIntellitype.dll is in there.</p>
    
    <p>If you created a shortcut to open Chatty that links to Java, then your
    working directory may be the folder where Java is in, instead of the folder
    where the Chatty.jar is in. In Windows, you can change the Working Directory
    in the shortcut settings by changing what is defined under <code>Run in</code>.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If a user is timed out in one channel, Chatty may show the timeouts in
    other channels as well. This is because there is no channel associated with
    timeouts or bans in Twitch Chat, so the program has to guess in which
    channel the timeout occured. See also: <a href="help.html#channels">Joining more than one channel</a>.</p>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you repeatedly get disconnected because of possibly invalid login
    data, please open the Connect Dialog and choose <code>Configure login.. - Verify login</code>.
    This will send a request to Twitch to check if the access token is valid.
    If the login data is valid, then Twitch may just have temporary problems
    and you should try again later. The same goes for when the check itself
    fails because it can't reach the Twitch API.</p>
    <p>If the login data isn't valid, you can just remove the login and request
        new login data. Also see the <a href="#tokenDeleted">next section</a>
    for more information about invalid logins.</p>
    
    
    <h2>
        <a name="tokenDeleted">Login data (access token) was determined invalid and was removed.</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you get this message, then Chatty has performed an automatic check
    of the login data and determined that is was invalid.</p>
    <p>Reasons why the login data (access token) may be invalid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have requested new login data for the same Twitch Account from another instance of Chatty,
            for example on another Computer, which has automatically invalidated
            the previously requested login data (access token).</li>
        <li>You have just requested login data and something went wrong, or
        it wasn't loaded properly from the settings.</li>
        <li>The token was invalidated for some other reason.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How to proceed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to <code>Main - Connect - Request/Configure login ..</code> and
        get new login data. Disconnect first if you are connected.</li>
        <li>If you indeed want to use more than one instance of Chatty with the
        same account, check out <a href="help-guide1.html">this guide</a>.</li>

    </h2>
    <p>If you try to start the Chatty.jar directly, first check if .jar files
    are associated with Java, or maybe some other program like WinRAR.</p>
    <p>If you are sure that the Chatty.jar is actually started with Java, but
    no program appears, it may be that an error occured before the GUI could be
    created. You may find helpful information in the <code>&lt;user_dir&gt;\.chatty\debug.log</code>
    file (e.g. <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\.chatty\debug.log</code>). Sometimes there
    are several debug.log files, then just look for the newest one. It is overwritten
    every time you start Chatty. You can also try running Chatty from the commandline to
    get possible errormessages. Open a commandline in the folder where the Chatty.jar
    is and enter: <code>java -jar Chatty.jar</code></p>
