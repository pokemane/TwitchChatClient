<h2>
    <a name="0.6.2">Version 0.6.2 (This one!) (2014-04-20)</a>
    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
    <h3>Important Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The port setting has changed. If you have changed the port setting
        to another value before, it will be reverted to the new default with
        this update.</li>
        <li>With the introduction of group chat, Twitch apparently removed the
        "xy just subscribed" messages from the chat version Chatty uses. There
        was also a new version introduced that still has those messages and is
        generally better (association of bans/info messages/subscribers to
        channels), but it lacks joins/parts, which means no joins/parts can be
        shown and the userlist will only contain those people who have said
        something.<br />
        <br />
        If you don't care about showing joins/parts and you don't care about
        a correct/complete userlist, then it may be beneficial for you to
        enable the <code>Chat Client Version 3</code> option in the Settings
        Dialog under <code>Advanced</code>. <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">More information..</a></li>
    </ul>

<h2>
    <a name="0.5">Version 0.5</a> (2013-12-05)
    <a href="#top" class="top">[back to top]</a>
</h2>
<h3>Import Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>With Version 0.5, Chatty can notify you about streams you follow and
        show a list of them. You have to request
        new login data containing <code>&lt;Read user info&gt;</code> access to
        be able to use that. Go to 
        <code>&lt;Main - Connect - Configure login..&gt;</code>, remove the
        login and request it again.</li>
    <li>You can enable/disable this feature under
        <code>&lt;Main - Settings - Notifications&gt;</code> if you have the
        necessary access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Full Changelog</h3>
<pre>
New features:
- Get notified when streams you follow go online (requires
  &lt;Read user info&gt; access, which wasn't even in Chatty before, so you'll
  have to request new login data)
- View a list of live streams (you followed or whose channel you are in)
- FrankerFaceZ emoticons
- Added search, allowing you to find text in the current chat window
- Deleted messages (from timeouts/bans) now get shortened to a maximum length,
  or you can use the previous behaviour or let the whole message be replaced
  with &lt;message deleted&gt;
- Change the displayed time range in Viewer History
- Automatically check if the login is valid, if it is suspected not to be
- Clickable links in Channel Info Dialog (also turns #srl-abcd into a race link)
- Cycle between tabs with Ctrl+TAB

Changes:
- Updated Help
- Changed Settings Dialog Layout
- Detect subscribers even when in more than one channel (may not work correctly
  always, but it's a better guess than before)

Bugfixes:
- Changed color of inputbox cursor to foreground color
- Possibly made emoticon image loading a bit more reliable, but it's hard to
  tell what happens when the loading fails
- Handle long URLs in the URL open dialog better
</pre>
