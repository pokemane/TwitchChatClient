    <p>When in a channel, Chatty shows some information about that channel
    in the titlebar, e.g.:<br /><cite>[40|59] - GTA:SA Speedruns (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas)</cite></p>
    <p>The first number is the number of people in the chat, the second is the
    viewercount, followed by the current stream title and game. Anything other
    than the number of people in the chat is requested from the Twitch API about
    every two minutes.</p>

    </h2>
    <p>There are a few special symbols that are used for users in chat. These
    are displayed in the userlist and - if usericons are disabled - also in chat.</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>~ The Streamer</li>

    <p><a href="http://frankerfacez.com">FrankerFaceZ</a> provides a custom
    mod icon for some channels. You can disable this in the settings if you
    want to keep the default one for all channels.</p>

    </h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <p>The History is a graph that shows the development of the viewers
                    of the currently active channel and also indicates stream status changes
                    (online/offline/title/game) by different colors.</p>
                <p>Hover over points to display the stream status and viewercount
                at that time. Right-click for a context-menu.</p>
                <p>There are two ways to change which time range is being displayed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time Range</strong> means only the last <em>x hours</em>
                        are being displayed. For example if the whole data spans 10 hours
                        you can choose to only display the last 2 hours. This will display
                        the <em>maximum range</em> after the <em>actual range</em>
                        (even if the <em>actual range</em> isn't as long as the
                        <em>maximum range</em>):<br />
                        <code>15:32 - 19:14 (2h)</code><br />
                        You can change this via the context menu.
                    </li>
                    <li style="padding-top: 5px"><strong>Fixed Start/End</strong> means that either
                    the beginning of the displayed data is fixed or both the
                    beginning and end of the data are fixed, meaning that the
                    displayed graph will never change. The times that show the
                    <em>actual range</em> indicate whether they are fixed:<br />
                    <code>|15:58| - 19:14</code> or <code>|15:58| - |18:20|</code><br />
                    Double-click on a point to set it as a fixed start, then
                    double-click on another point to set it as a fixed end.
                    Double-click anywhere else to clear fixed start/end.
                    This setting is channel-specific and isn't saved when you
                    close Chatty.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The History is recorded while you have the channel open in Chatty
                as well as for all followed channels, if you have that feature
                enabled.</p>
                <p>The shown data usually fits to the available vertical space
                (so if the min/max viewercounts were 341/403 then only this
                range is shown). If you choose <code>Toggle Vertical</code> in
                the context-menu, you can switch between the shown range
                (min/max) and the full range (0-max).</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="nickCompletion">Nick Completion</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>Enter the beginning of a nick of a user that is currently online, then
        press TAB to auto-complete it. For example entering <code>jo</code> and
        pressing TAB may change it to <code>joshimuz</code>. If there is no
        matching nick, nothing will happen. If there is more than one matching nick,
        you can cycle through them by pressing TAB repeatedly. For example
        <code>jo</code> might cycle between <code>john</code>, <code>jolzi</code>
        and <code>joshimuz</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="inputHistory">Input History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>When you send a message, it is automatically saved into a input history,
    which you can access (while having the cursor in the input box) by pressing
    the <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd>-key, which will replace the current contents of
    the input box with the previously send message. You can go further back and
    forth again using <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd>.</p>
    <p>Pressing <kbd>Down-Arrow</kbd> after entering or changing a message, 
    removes it and stores it in the history, so you can go back to it and send
    it later. Pressing <kbd>Up-Arrow</kbd> after entering or changing a message
    will replace it with the previous history entry without saving it.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="channels">Joining more than one channel</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p><em>This only applies when you don't have the <code>Chat Client Version 3</code>
            option in the <code>Advanced</code> settings enabled. <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">More Information..</a></em></p>
    <p>It is possible to join more than one channel with Chatty, however it
    does have some disadvantages. Several messages from the Chat-Server don't
    have a channel associated with them (Bans/Timeouts, Specialusers), so while being
    joined to more than one channel on a single connection, they can't be reliably
    associated with a channel.</p>
    <p>Joining more than one channel means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bans/Timeouts are shown in all open channels where the username
        that was Banned/Timed out was found in, or if it wasn't found all
        open channels.</li>
        <li>Subscribers should be recognized after writing two messages, but it
            may not always work reliably.</li>
        <li>Info messages from the Twitch chat (like <cite>This channel is now in slow-mode</cite>) are displayed in the currently
        active channel.</li>
        <li>Admin/Staff/Turbo users should be global, so these shouldn't pose
        a problem.</li>
        <li>Moderators work differently, so those shouldn't be a problem
        either.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="notifications">Live Streams / Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty can show Tray Notifications when the status of a stream changes.
        There is also a Live Streams window (<code>Channels - Live Channels</code>)
        that shows the currently live streams. Both these features always include channels you have
        joined and - if enabled - channels you have followed. Streams that are
        no longer online, or whose channels you have left and you don't follow,
        are added to a list that you can open in the Live Streams window context
        menu (<code>Removed streams..</code>).</p>
    
    <h3><a name="followed">Followed Streams</a></h3>
    <p>Chatty can request a list of streams you follow on a regular basis, so
    you have both an overview of currently live streams as well as be
    informed about status changes (offline -> online, title change, game change).
    This is always available for streams whose channels you have joined in chat,
    but with this feature enabled, this works for all streams you follow even
    without joining their channel.</p>
    <p>This feature requires <code>Read user info</code> access, so Chatty can
        request your followed streams. Read the <a href="#login">section about login</a>
    to learn more about login data and access.</p>
    <p>You can enable/disable this feature in the Settings under <code>Notifications</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="admin">Admin Dialog</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>In the Admin Dialog you can change the title/game of your channel and
    run commercials, if you have allowed the necessary access when getting your
    login data. You need <code>Editor access</code> for changing game/title and
    <code>Commercial access</code> for running commercials. See <a href="#access">allow more access</a>.</p>
    <p>The Admin Dialog is always opened for the currently selected channel,
    unless there is no channel open (which is the case just after you started Chatty),
    in which case it will always be opened for your own channel, which is derived
    from your configured account name.</p>
    
    <h3>Change game/title</h3>
    <p>The Status-Tab lets you view and change the title and game of your channel.
    The information is loaded when you open the dialog and when you press the
    <code>reload</code>-Button. If others may have changed the info in the meantime,
    you may want to reload before trying to change it.</p>
    
    <h3>Select a game</h3>
    <p>When you select a game, another dialog will open where you should enter
        part of the name of the game in the search field and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
        or click the <code>Search</code>-Button to find the correct name, which
    you can then select. You can also just use the name you entered yourself,
    but you should usually use the search to make sure your stream appears in
    the correct category on Twitch.</p>
    
    <h3>Use presets</h3>
    <p>There are also status presets, which allow you to add a combination of
        title and game, so you can select it later. By pressing <code>Fav</code>
        on the Status-Tab, you can add the current status to the favorites.
        The status is also automatically added to the history every time you
        press the <code>Update</code> button.</p>
    <p>Press the <code>Presets</code> button to open a table with the favorites
        and status history. You can filter the table by only showing entries for
        the game currently have selected or only showing favorites.</p>
    <p>History entries (the ones that are not favorites) are automatically
        removed after some time, you can change when they are removed and
        whether they should be added in the first place in the settings.</p>
    <p>The <code>Last Activity</code> columns shows when this status was last
        set using the <code>Update</code> button (or when it was added to the
        favorites for the first time). The <code>Usage</code> column shows how
        often it was set using the <code>Update</code> button.</p>

    <h3>Run commercials</h3>
    <p>If you are partnered with Twitch, you can run commercials on your channel
    here (even if you are not partnered it may run a commercial). Click on the
    appropriate button to try to run a commercial of the given length.</p>
    <p>If you
    select <code>Use delay</code>, then the commercial will be run after the
    specified time. Examples for times: <code>30</code> (30 seconds), <code>5m</code>
    (5 minutes), <code>120s</code> (2 minutes). You can change the commercial
    length during the wait by clicking another button. Click the currently
    selected length button to cancel the scheduled commercial. Scheduled
    commercials are no completely exact, they may be run a few seconds too late.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="login">Login data</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>The login data consists of a <em>username</em> (or account name) and most importantly an <em>access token</em>, which is sort of a
    revokable password that can also have different types of access associated with it, some of them being:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chat access (which is obviously needed for Chatty)</li>
        <li>Read user info (which is required to request the streams you follow)</li>
        <li>Editor access (which allows you to change the title/game of your stream)</li>
        <li>Commercials access (which allows you to run commercials on your stream)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once requested from Twitch, the login data is stored locally on your computer
    along with the other settings of Chatty. Since Twitch gives out the access token
    per application, any access token for the same account requested with Chatty
    will be invalidated when you request a new access token.</p>
    <p>If getting login data fails, read <a href="help-guide2.html">this guide</a>.</p>
    <h3><a name="access">Allow more access</a></h3>
    <p>To allow Chatty more access than it already has (e.g. if you haven't selected
        editor access before, but you want it now),
        you need to request a new access token.
    Just go to <code>Main - Connect - Configure login</code> (you have to be disconnected), delete the login
    and request it again with the necessary access.</p>
    
    <h3>Allow less access</h3>
    <p>To allow Chatty less access than it already has (e.g. you don't want it to have
    editor access anymore) you need to first revoke access completely in your Twitch
    Account Settings, then authorize access again. What will not work is just requesting
    a new token without selecting the now unwanted access. Twitch will always respond with a token that has at least as much
    access as the previous one.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="favorites">Favorites / History</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If enabled, the history automatically saves channels you join and when
    you last joined them. By default channels expire from the history after
    30 days of not joining them (can be changed).</p>
    <p>You can also add channels from the history or any
    you enter manually to the favorites, which will always be kept until you
    remove them yourself.</p>

        <a name="highlight">Highlight</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>

    <p>The highlight system allows you to add words or phrases that make chat
    messages appear in another color and appear in a seperate window, which you can
    open under <code>View - Highlights</code> (you can clear the highlights window
    in it's context menu).</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="userColors">User Colors</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>The color of a user is displayed in the User Info Dialog. Color Names
    are used where possible, HTML Color Codes are displayed in the Tooltip.
    Colors with asterisk (*) are default colors (the user hasn't set one
    or hasn't said anything during this session yet). A color in parentheses
    means it's the original color, while the other color is the corrected one
    that is actually displayed.</p>
    <h3>Corrected Colors</h3>
    <p>Chatty attempts to make colors more readable automatically by changing
    them to increase contrast. This doesn't work very well though, although it
    should work for extreme cases like white on white or black on black.</p>
    
    <h3>Custom Colors</h3>
    <p>You can also specify custom colors for certain users or types of users
    in the settings. Custom colors are indicated by two asterisks (**) in the
    User Info Dialog.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="emoticons">Emoticons</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>Chatty supports the default Twitch Emoticons (Normal/Turbo/Subscriber),
    which should work the same as in normal Twitch Chat. It however also
    supports <a href="http://frankerfacez.com/">FrankerFaceZ</a>, a custom
    set of emotes that is normally made available in normal Twitch Chat by use of browser
    extensions.</p>
    <p>You can enable/disable Emoticons in general (displaying the icons instead
        of the text) in the settings under <code>Main</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="addressbook">Addressbook</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
    <p>The addressbook allows you to add usernames and assign categories to
    them, which can then be used in other places such as the Usercolor settings
    or the Highlight settings.</p>
    <p>The addressbook can be edited in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The addressbook dialog (<code>&lt;Main Menu&gt; - Channels - Addressbook</code>)
        where all entries are listed and you can add/edit/remove entries.</li>
        <li>From the user context menu (when you click on a user, then <code>Addressbook</code>)
        where the entry for this user can be directly added/edited/removed. There
        you can just select/unselect the categories this user should be in
        (although only the categories that are already used in the addressbook
        are listed, so if you want to add a completely
        new category, you have to add it once by manually editing an entry).</li>
        <li>The commands that are listed below.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Commands</h3>
    <p>In addition to the addressbook dialog and user context menu, there are also some commands to
        edit the addressbook. All commands are prefixed with <code>/ab</code>
        (e.g. <code>/ab add &lt;name&gt;</code>) or alternatively <code>/users</code> (e.g. <code>/users add &lt;name&gt;</code>):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>add &lt;name&gt;</code> - Adds a name</li>
        <li><code>add &lt;name&gt; &lt;categories&gt;</code> - Adds a name and directly assigns it the given categories, or adds the
        categories to the name if it already exists</li>
        <li><code>set &lt;name&gt; &lt;categories&gt;</code> - Sets the categories for this name, adding it if necessary, replacing
        any present categories for this name</li>
        <li><code>remove &lt;name&gt;</code> - Completely removes the given name</li>
        <li><code>remove &lt;name&gt; &lt;categories&gt;</code> - Removes the given categories from this name, but leaves
        the name</li>
        <li><code>get &lt;name&gt;</code> - Shows the categories for this name</li>
        <li><code>info</code> - Shows number of entries and used categories</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Categories are given as a comma-seperated list without spaces, e.g. <code>cat1,cat2,cat3</code>.</p>
    <p>The following commands edit all entries at once, so they should be used with care:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>renameCategory &lt;currentName&gt; &lt;newName&gt;</code> - Renames a category, which means all occurences
            of <code>currentName</code> are replaced with <code>newName</code> in all entries. This can also
            be used to merge categories, if <code>newName</code> already exists.</li>
        <li><code>removeCategory &lt;name&gt;</code> - Removes the category with the given name from all entries</li>
    </ul>

        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
     </h2>
     <p>You can enable the option <code>Ignore joins/parts</code> in the
         <code>Advanced</code> Settings to ignore all joins and parts, this
         means the userlist and the usercount will only be based on people who
         actually wrote something.
     The program will not register joins/parts at all. This can be useful in
     really big channels (like 10,000+ users) because having this big a userlist
     can reduce performance.</p>
     
     <p><em>It may be better to enable the
             <a href="help-settings.html#Advanced-Other">Chat Client Version 3</a>
             setting instead, which makes the chat not even send joins/parts.
         </em></p>
     
     
     <p><em>This is not to be confused with the option <code>Show joins/parts</code>
             which only affects if joins/parts should be shown in the chat window.</em></p>

    <p>There are a couple of commands that allow you to change settings from
        the chat inputbox. <em>You should know what you're doing
        before using these.</em> <code>/set &lt;setting&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code>
    changes a setting, <code>/get &lt;setting&gt;</code> shows the current value
    of a setting, <code>/reset &lt;setting&gt;</code> resets the setting to
    the default (hard-coded) value, <code>/clearsetting &lt;setting&gt;</code> sets
    string settings to an empty string.</p>
    <p>Some of the available settings include (this list may be incomplete/incorrect):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Font: <code>font</code>, <code>fontSize</code>, <code>lineSpacing</code></li>
        <li>Colors (each taking a named color or html color code):

    </h2>
    <p>Settings are loaded from files when Chatty is started and saved into files
        once it is closed. By default these files are saved in a subfolder
        <code>.chatty</code> of your user directory. You can also use the
        <code>-cd</code> commandline parameter to use the current working
    directory instead. You can find out which folder is used by entering the
    <code>/dir</code> command.</p>
    <p>Since Version 0.4 of Chatty, the settings are no longer saved in a single
        <code>settings</code>-file, but instead several files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>login</code>: Contains the login data, including the access
        token, which should be kept confidential.</li>
        <li><code>favoritesAndHistory</code>: Contains channel history and
        favorites, as well as game favorites.</li>
        <li><code>settings</code>: The main file, which contains all customizations
        made to Chatty that should not be confidential or private.</li>
