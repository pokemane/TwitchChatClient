    <h3>Timeouts/Bans</h3>
    <p>This allows you to define how timeouts or bans are displayed in Chatty.
    There are three options for deleted messages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete Message</strong> completely replaces the message with
            <code>&lt;message deleted&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike through</strong> will keep the whole message displayed, but
        crossed out.</li>
        <li><strong>Strike through, shorten</strong> is same as the previous one, but
        it will also shorten the message to the defined number of characters, so long
        spam messages don't take as much space, but can mostly still be identified what
        they were about. Shortened messages are indicated by the points at the end
        that are <em>not</em> crossed out (e.g. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Deleted spam message Long copy pas</span>..).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capitalized Names</strong> simply capitalizes the first letter of
    names, it doesn't make the names capitalized correctly as they are on the
    Twitch Profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Show stream status in chat</strong> outputs the stream status
        (title and game) in the chat window on join and when it changes
        (when the stream goes offline or online or changes the title or game).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Usercolors">Usercolors</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>This allows you to specify your own usercolors for either certain types
        of users (mod, subscriber etc.) or specific usernames. There are special
    items that you can use to specify that (to specify a username, just enter
    it without anything else):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>$mod</code> - Moderators</li>
        <li><code>$sub</code> - Subscribers</li>
        <li><code>$turbo</code> - Turbo Users</li>
        <li><code>$admin</code> - Admins</li>
        <li><code>$staff</code> - Staff members</li>
        <li><code>$all</code> - All users, this can be used to specify a default
        color (should be put at the very end of the list)</li>
        <li><code>$cat:&lt;category&gt;</code> - A category from the Addressbook</li>
        <li><code>#&lt;color code&gt;</code> - A Html color code, e.g. <code>#0000FF</code> for blue, which can
            be used to replace colors</li>
        <li><code>$color:&lt;color code or name&gt;</code> - A Html color code or name (names
            as hardcoded into Chatty, may be different from other programs), e.g. <code>$color:Blue</code> for blue,
            which can be used to replace colors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The order of the
    entries in the table matters, because it is checked from the top. If you
    were to put the <code>$all</code> item at the very top, any items below
    wouldn't do anything, because the first item would already match all users.
    This e.g. allows you to specify what color a user should have when he is
    both a subscriber and a moderator (by either putting <code>$mod</code>
    or <code>$sub</code> first).</p>
    
    <p>If an item is red and has "(error)" appended (e.g. "<span style="color:red">$color.Blue (error)</span>"),
    this means the item is invalid. In the example this is because a point has
    been used instead of a colon, so "$color:Blue" would be correct. This can
    also happen if it doesn't recognize the given color or the item is just in
    an invalid format.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Highlight">Highlight</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>General settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enable Highlight</strong>: Determines whether highlighting
        is enabled at all.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight own name</strong>: Makes messages that contain your
        own name (case-insensitive) highlighted, even if you didn't add it to the list manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight own text</strong>: Highlights your own messages if
        they match the criteria, which can be particularly useful to test whether your terms
        are being matched correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight follow-up</strong>: After a highlighted message,
        also highlight the following messages of the same user for a certain time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Add terms to be highlighted</h3>
    <p>Add items to the list to make a message highlighted if any one of them
    match the message.</p>
    <p>By default, highlighting is done case-insensitive and when the word or phrase appears
    anywhere in the message. However, there are prefixes you can add to the
    very beginning of the items to change this behaviour:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>cs:</code> makes it case-sensitive, so <code>cs:test</code>
            matches <code>test</code> but not <code>Test</code>.</li>
        <li><code>w:</code> matches at word boundaries, e.g. <code>w:anna</code>
            will match <code>anna</code> or <code>Anna:</code> but not <code>Hannah</code> or <code>annah</code>.</li>
        <li><code>wcs:</code> is the same as <code>w:</code>, but case-sensitive.</li>
        <li><code>re:</code> to use a regular expression, e.g. <code>re:(?i).*GTA ?[V5].*</code>
        to match GTA5, GTA 5, GTA V, gta5, .. anywhere in the message. Note
        that the regex always tries to match the entire message, so you have to
        add the appropriate wildcards to match parts anywhere in the message.</li>
        <li><code>user:</code> to specifiy one exact username (case-insensitive)
            which should highlight if this user send the message, doesn't search in
            the message itself.</li>
        <li><code>cat:</code> to specify a category the user who send the message
        should be in (as defined in the Addressbook).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that each item in the list represents one word or phrase. So 
        <code>word1 word2</code> matches if <code>word1 word2</code> appears
        anywhere in the message, not if <code>word1</code> and/or <code>word2</code>
        appear anywhere in the message. This means you also can't have prefixes
        in the middle or combine them with different phrases:
        <code>cs:abc re:\w+</code> matches <code>abc re:\w+</code> not
        <code>abc test</code> for example (for which you would need <code>re:abc \w+</code>).</p>
    <p>However, you can prefix another term with a user: <code>user:username cs:test</code>
        matches if <code>test</code> appears anywhere in the message AND if
        the message is from <code>username</code>. It doesn't work in another order
        though: <code>cs:test user:username</code>
        would match <code>test user:username</code>. The same applies for the <code>cat:</code> prefix.</p>

    <h2>
        <a name="Sounds">Sounds</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>General Sound Settings</h3>
    <p>You can enable or disable all sounds here. Sounds are searched in the
    displayed folder, which is the current working directory. Any valid sound
    files in the folder should be selectable as a sound to be played. If you
    added or removed files, you may have to use <code>Rescan folder</code> to
    make the files show up in the list. You can open the folder in your standard
    file browser from here to add files to it more quickly.</p>
    
    <h3>Sound Types Settings</h3>
    <p>You can specify requirements, soundfile, volume and delay for three
        different types of events:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When a message is highlighted</li>
        <li>When a stream changes status (online/offline/changed title/changed game)</li>
        <li>When any message in received in any open channel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can set a delay (seconds) so that the same sound won't be played twice during
    the set number of seconds. So if e.g. 3 highlighted messages come in within
    10 seconds and the delay is set to 15 seconds, only one sound will be played.</p>
    
    <p>Each sound has different options for when the sound should be played. See
        the <a href="#Notifications">Notification Settings</a> for help on the options.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Notifications">Notifications</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Select when a notification should be shown for either <em>Highlight</em>
        (when a message in chat is highlighted) or <em>Stream Status</em> (when
    Chatty learns of a new stream status, e.g. offline -> online, new game, new
    title etc.).</p>
    
    <p>There are different options for when a notification should be shown:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Off</strong> - Never show</li>
        <li><strong>When channel/app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab AND when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel or app not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab OR when the program doesn't have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When app not active</strong> - Only when the program doesn't
        have focus</li>
        <li><strong>When channel not active</strong> - Only when the channel
        isn't the currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>When channel active</strong> - Only when the channel IS the
        currently selected tab</li>
        <li><strong>Always</strong> - No requirements, always show it</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Notification Type / Options</h3>
    <p>Select here whether to use the <em>Chatty Notifications</em> or the default
        <em>System Tray Notifications</em>. This settings DOES NOT enable or
    disable notifications altogether, just switch between the types.</p>
    <p>If you have <em>Chatty Notifications</em> selected, you can change some
    more options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Position:</strong> In which corner the the notification appears on the screen</li>
        <li><strong>Screen:</strong> On which screen the notification appears (<code>auto</code> means
        it's on the same screen as the Chatty window)</li>
        <li><strong>Display Time:</strong> How long the notification will be displayed
        by default. This can vary a bit depending on the situation.</li>
        <li><strong>No User Activity:</strong> This is a tricky one. If you enable
        this, then the notification will not be closed after the defined Display Time
        if no activity was detected in the last few seconds. This can be useful
        to still see notifications from a few minutes ago if you were away from
        the computer.
        The time defines
        when the notification will be closed no
        matter what, so older notifications won't stay there forever if you are
        away from the computer for a bit longer. 
        <br /><br />Activity is tracked through two methods: 
        The first method is tracking the system-wide mouse movements, which is
        done through an API that may not always return accurate information
        (e.g. if you are in a game) and it only checks the position every few
        seconds (only the last location is saved at any time for comparison).
        The second method detects activity only inside of Chatty, by tracking
        button presses and mouse actions (e.g. if you type a message, open a
        dialog etc.).</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Followed Streams</h3>
    <p>Enable this to make Chatty get a list of your followed streams regulary
    so it can display notifications if their status changes. This simpy allows
    Chatty to know about your followed streams, so notifications aren't the only
    advantage. It also allows it to record the viewer count and status history
    of followed live streams as long as Chatty is running.</p>
    
    <h2>
        <a name="Logging">Logging</a>
        <a href="#top" class="top">[back to menu]</a>
    </h2>
    <p>If you enable logging, chat messages (and more if enabled) will be written
    into a seperate textfile for each channel.</p>
    <h3>Channels</h3>
    <p>You can specify which channels should be logged:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>always</strong> - Log all channels without exception</li>
        <li><strong>blacklist</strong> - Log all channels, except the ones on
        the blacklist</li>
        <li><strong>whitelist</strong> - Log no channels, except the ones on the
        whitelist</li>
        <li><strong>off</strong> - Log no channels whatsoever</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Messages Types</h3>
    <p>Normal chat messages are always logged, however you can log additional
    information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chat Info</strong> refers to general chat releated info messages
        like connecting/disconnecting/trying to timeout someone/stream title..</li>
        <li><strong>Bans/Timeouts</strong> refers to bans/timeouts in chat, which
            will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] BAN: name, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>Mod/Unmod</strong> refers to when someone in chat is modded/
            unmodded, which will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] MOD: name1, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>Joins/Parts</strong> refers to when someone joins/parts the
        channel, which will be logged like this: <code>[12:32:25] JOIN: name1, name2</code></li>
        <li><strong>System Info</strong> means any info messages that are related
        more to Chatty than chat itself, like info about new versions, if you use
        settings commands..</li>
        <li><strong>Viewerstats</strong> are stats about the viewercount which
        are logged in a semi-regular interval to give some idea about the viewercount
        during that time. It shows which interval it refers to, the min/max/avg viewers,
        the number of values and the development (first value/after offline is absolute, then +-
        relative change, _ means offline before/in between/after that value, e.g.
        <code>[21:06:21] Viewerstats (21:03-21:06): avg:28.612 min:28.432 max:28.887 [3/28.519-87+455_]</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Viewercount</strong> will log the viewercount as it is updated,
            like this: <code>[15:23:58] VIEWERS: 12521</code></li>
    </ul>

                window) when you open them.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep location during session</strong>: Puts dialogs
                at the same position when you reopen them during the same
                session (so they are put on the default location when you open
                them the first time after starting Chatty).</li>
                <li><strong>Restore dialogs from last session</strong>: Puts
                dialogs at the same position they were at when you closed Chatty
                last session and also keeps the position during the session.</li>
                <li><strong>Reopen dialogs from last session</strong>: Reopens

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scroll down after 30s of inactivity</strong>: If you scrolled
        up in chat but haven't moved scrollposition in 30s, it will scroll down
        if new messages come in. This prevents accidently scrolling up from hiding
        new messages.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat buffer size</strong>: How many lines of text are kept
        for each channel in chat to scroll back to.</li>
        <li><strong>Inform me about new versions</strong>: Checks for new
        versions every few days and outputs a message about it.</li>
        <li><strong>Timeout buttons</strong>: Change the times of the timeout
        buttons in the user dialog. Times are comma-seperated and interpreted as
        seconds by default, but you can add suffixes to change that (s - seconds,
        m - minutes, h - hours, d - days). Without a suffix, the button label is
        automatically made, with a suffix that text is used (for example "120"
        creates a button with a 120s timeout, with a label of "2m", "120s"
        creates the same button, but with a label of "120s").</li>

    <p>The values of these settings are used when connecting, unless the commandline
        parameters <code>-server</code> and/or <code>-port</code> are used,
    then the value that is given there is used instead (without it being shown

        <li><strong>Ignore joins/parts</strong>: Completely ignore joins/parts

        <li><strong>Chat Client Version 3</strong>: Twitch Chat has different
            client versions, that makes it send different messages. Version 3

            other Versions. See the table below for a comparison.<br /><br />
            tl;dr It probably makes sense to enable this if you don't care about:
            joins/parts, a complete userlist or a correct usercount.<br /><br />

                The userlist will only contain users who have said something and
                users who were modded. They will stay in the userlist until you
                close the channel (or close Chatty altogether of course).<br /><br />
                The usercount (number on the left in the title) is based on the
                userlist, so it won't be correct either (viewercount is unaffected).
